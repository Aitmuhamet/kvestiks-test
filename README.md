# Kvestiks.ru Webpage Project

This project is a responsive webpage layout for the Kvestiks.ru website. It was given to me as a test assignment for a job application. The layout was created based on the design provided in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/H1ejjnGamGN22KYmUVrJlQ/product_page?node-id=1-1518&node-type=text&m=dev).

## Project Overview

This project is built using Gulp as the task runner, with SCSS and other tools for automating front-end development tasks.

- **Task**: Develop the layout of the product page according to the design provided.
- **Purpose**: Personal development and demonstration of my coding skills.
- **Developer**: I am the sole developer working on this project.

## Features

- Responsive layout
- Organized code structure
- Optimized for production
- Built with Gulp, SCSS, and other modern front-end tools

## Installation

To install the project, run the following command from the project's root directory:

```bash
npm i
```

## Development Build
To start the development build with Gulp, run:

gulp
```

This will compile the SCSS, bundle the assets, and start a local development server with live reload.
